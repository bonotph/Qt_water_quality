## Water Quality Monitor
This App displays data about the water quality in England.

There are 5 main pages:
- the dashboard
- pollutant overview
- environmental litter
- flourinated compounds
- compliance dashboard

Each page shows graphs or tables to make the data easily understanable and give an overview.

There is also a table view which was mainly made for the first developing stage to see how the data can be accessed though now it can be used if one is looking for a specific measurement or wants to see the raw data.

## How to run the application

Set up the build process with

    mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..

Build the application with

    make 

Run the application with

    ./window

Make sure you have the Y-2024.csv file containing the data in the coursework directory
